I recently learned and implemented MVVM architecture in my movies rating app. By separating the app into models, views, and view models, I achieved cleaner and more efficient code.

Using dummy REST APIs, I created login and signup pages, focusing on ViewModel implementation and data flow management.

For the home screen, I integrated a movie list API to fetch and display movie data. The ViewModel ensured a smooth user experience.

MVVM improved code quality and app performance.
