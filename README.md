I recently learned and implemented MVVM architecture in my movies rating app. By separating the app into models, views, and view models, I achieved cleaner and more efficient code.

Using dummy REST APIs, I created login and signup pages, focusing on ViewModel implementation and data flow management.

For the home screen, I integrated a movie list API to fetch and display movie data. The ViewModel ensured a smooth user experience.

This journey taught me valuable lessons in code organization and reactive programming. MVVM improved code quality and app performance.

Excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts in MVVM and app development!
